Grand Plan
==

1. Prototype in Python
2. Rewrite in C
3. Profit!


Step 1: Prototype In Python
==

* Add basic setup.py to install
* Add more sources
  - Geoclue street address
  - Geoclue position
  - Active video output (blocking on xrandr event notification, should be in xserver 1.5)
* Add more actions
  - Mute/unmute sound card
  - Enable/disable a VPN (invoke NM)
  - Set presence in Mission Control (Empathy etc)
* Remove polling in main loop and instead add a PollAction class which uses
  timeouts to emit signals
