A clone of Marco Polo[1] for GNOME.  Named after the British explorer Ernest
Shackleton[2].

Concepts
===

Location rules.  These look at the environment and if they
evaluate to true, then indicate that you are at a certain location.  For
example, a rule could look at the MAC address of the gateway and use it to
determine that you are in the office.

Actions.  These run when either entering or leaving a location.

interface Rule {
	  /* 0 to n gobject properties, which are used to configure the rule.
	  The type and blurb is used to construct a UI */

	  /* The name of the context */
	  char *context;
	  /* Description for humans */
	  char *description;
	  /* How confident is this rule, from 0 to 1. */
	  double confidence;

	  /* Evaluate the rule */
	  gboolean evaluate ();

	  /* Some rules can be notified instead of polling (such as active
	  wireless network), these emit signals. */
	  signal evaluated(gboolean);
}

Rule sources:
- default gateway mac address
- wireless AP name
- time of day
- attached USB devices

Actions:
- run command
- debug (show a dialog with a string)
- mount/umount file system
- change screen saver password
